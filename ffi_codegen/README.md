# ffi_codegen

`ffi_codegen` is a Rust crate that provides autogenerated C functions for evaluating symbolic expressions. The crate is primarily intended for use as a bridge between Rust and C, enabling symbolic computation logic to be accessed from C code.

## Features

- **Autogenerated Code**: Most of the code in this crate is generated automatically.
- **Symbolic Expression Evaluation**: Exposes C-callable functions that evaluate symbolic expressions.
- **FFI Compatibility**: Designed for seamless integration with C projects via Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

## Usage
Exported functions are in auto_matrix.rs files like `pub fn rk4_cartpole_jacobian_x_assemble_matrix(args: &[f64]) -> DMatrix<f64>`. 
In particular, this function implements the jacobian of the discretized double pendulum dynamics using RK4 with respect to state (State matrix).
The arguments are all included in a &[f64] slice, and include: 
- state parameters
- input parameters
- model parameters
- dt
